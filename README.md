## Suparna Bhattacharjee(https://github.com/suparnabh),  Sruthi Karicheri, Jennie Ran (https://github.com/jran14)

###### Scope of the Project::point_down:

1.	To build a prediction model to determine the downhole pressure of a test well.
2.	To understand the interdependencies of the different variables in the dataset 

###### Task Breakdown::point_down:
a.	Extraction and Understanding of the production and subsurface dataset. 
    
    Analyze the various production parameters from each well and establish correlations and variances.

b.	Transforming the dataset 

    â€“ Performing some data wrangling and clean up
    - exploratory data analysis

c.	Design training and testing parameters/wells.

    - linear regression 
    - Basic Linear model with Lasso shrinkage
    - random forest regression model
