# PREDICTION OF DOWNHOLE PRESSURE USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

## Suparna Bhattacharjee,  Sruthi Karicheri, Jennie Ran (https://github.com/jran14)

###### Scope of the Project:

1.	To build a prediction model to determine the downhole pressure of a test well.
2.	To understand the interdependencies of the different variables in the dataset 

###### Task Breakdown:
a.	Extraction and Understanding of the production and subsurface dataset. 
    
    Analyze the various production parameters from each well and establish correlations and variances.

b.	Transforming the dataset 
    â€“ Performing some data wrangling and clean up
    - exploratory data analysis

c.	Design training and testing parameters/wells.
    - linear regression 
    - Basic Linear model with Lasso shrinkage
    - random forest regression model
