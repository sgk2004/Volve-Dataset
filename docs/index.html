                <h3 class="headers">Introduction</h3>
                <p class="textfont">In 2018, Equinor released a comprehensive set of oilfield data from the
                    Volve Field in the North Sea for public research and development. The Volve Field is located
                    (Figure 1) approximately 200 km west of Stavanger, Norway. The field was discovered in 1993
                    and approved for production in 2005. Subsequently the field was decommissioned in 2018 as the
                    oil and gas production
                    became uneconomical. In this study, we used production data from the Volve
                    Field. During the 2008 to 2016 period a number of wells produced oil and associated gas from
                    this field. This case study was carried out for the partial fulfillment of the Data
                    Analytics Boot Camp at the Rice University, Houston, USA.
                </p>
                <h3 class="headers">Scope of the Project</h3>
                <p class="textfont">Oil and gas production is a highly capital-intensive process and it is
                    associated with high HSE risk. Therefore, a large number of sensors/gauges are used to
                    monitor seamless production of fluids from each of the wells in a field. These sensors are
                    generally classified into two, downhole sensors and wellhead sensors. The downhole sensors
                    are costly due to the extreme conditions (e.g. pressure and temperature) that they need to
                    withstand down the hole and also have associated high maintenance cost. Therefore, an
                    opportunity to avoid installation of downhole sensors, without compromising the flow
                    assurance as well as safety of the well is highly desired by production companies.
                </p>
                <p class="textfont">
                    In this study, we explore various Machine Learning (ML) methods that could
                    potentially predict the downhole pressure data, which traditionally is measured using a
                    downhole sensor, from various wellhead measurements.

                <p class="textfont">Among the data released, five wells have the complete data sets (Variables) that
                    could be used in the ML (Figure 2). Among those five wells, two discovery wells were drilled on
                    the crest of the structure and three appraisal wells were drilled on its flanks. All these wells
                    are either highly deviated or horizonal in geometry. The two discovery wells started production
                    from 2008, while the commencements of production from the three appraisal wells were by the end
                    of 2013 and early 2014.
                </p>
                <p class="textfont">All the five wells got a total of 24 categorical and numerical data (Variable)
                    from both wellhead and downhole measurements. Out of the total number of variables, five
                    numerical variables such as, choke size, wellhead pressure, wellhead temperature, oil volume,
                    gas volume and water volume were taken as test variables and downhole pressure was taken as the
                    target variable (Figure 3).

                    <p class="textfont">The three Machine Learning methods (Figure 6) provided varying levels of
                        predictability of downhole pressure from the wellhead variables (Table 1). While the Linear
                        regression method gave least predictability (R2 = 0.56), Neural network method provided the
                        highest level of predictability (R2 = 0.89). Random Forrest method gave R2 value 0.82
                        predictability.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="textfont">The study overall concludes that downhole pressure could be reasonably well
                        predicted from the wellhead measurements, using either the Neural Network or the Random Forrest
                        method. At the other end, the linear regression method cannot be used for reliable downhole
                        pressure prediction.</p>
